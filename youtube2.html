                    <h3>Using for Teaching</h3>

                       <li>Free lecture content</li>
                    There are literally thousands of educational videos that can supplement course material—and, best of all, they’re free. For example, TED Talks offers more than 3,000 lectures from experts in their field, while non-profits, educational organizations and large broadcasters such as the BBC’s Open University offer their own YouTube channels with quality content. Tip: Don’t use video to replace a lecture, but rather to complement it.

                    <li>Curate your own playlists</li>
                    Once you create an account, you can curate playlists, bringing together diverse voices on a particular subject. You can show videos in class (as an intro to a new topic, for active learning or for a research project) or assign videos to be viewed outside of class. You can also recommend students subscribe to relevant subject-related playlists for supplemental learning.

                            <br>
                    <li>Customize your lessons</li>
                    Tools like EdPuzzle can help you crop videos, add commentary and incorporate quizzes. TED-Ed also allows you to create customized lessons by adding discussion topics and interactive questions to TED-Ed Animations or TED Talks, which can be shared with students.

                    <li>Flip the classroom</li>
                    The ability to curate your own videos helps to facilitate flipped classrooms. Students watch the assigned videos on their own time, at their own pace (and as often as they’d like). Instructors can even create videos of their lectures to be viewed outside of the classroom, freeing up class time for discussions, group work and interactive assignments.

                        <h3>Cautions and Warnings</h3>
    
                <ol type="1">
                        <p>When you sign up for an account at YouTube, you have to provide a date of birth. YouTube requires users to be 13 or older. The site uses your age to help filter out videos that it has given age restrictions to, usually as a response to other users flagging the content. Age restrictions do not prevent kids from lying about their age, though, leaving parents to monitor whether their kids are following the rules.

                        In February 2010, YouTube added a way to give parents control over their kids' YouTube experience: Safety Mode. This feature allows you to filter out potentially offensive YouTube content. Safety Mode will apply to anyone else using YouTube in that Web browser on that computer, whether or not they're signed in to an account.



                        When Safety Mode is on, YouTube cleans up its act as follows:

                        The site doesn't display videos marked as having mature content or that have an age restriction, including linking directly to the video or seeing it as a suggested video.
                        The site replaces certain words with asterisks, like when you use the "Hide objectionable words" feature in the Text Comments section.
                        The site boosts the filter on its search results using Google's search algorithms, and it prevents searching entirely with some words.
                        To start using Safety Mode in YouTube, scroll to the bottom of any YouTube page and click the "Safety Mode: Off" link. A small dialog box appears in your browser window. Click "Save" to enable Safety Mode. To lock YouTube in Safety Mode, log in as a registered user, and click "Save and lock" instead of "Save." With the lock, Safety Mode will apply to anyone using the same browser, even after you've signed out.

                        The expected way to unlock Safety Mode is to sign in with the same account you used to lock it, click the linked Safety Mode status at the top or bottom of the page, click the unlock button, and enter your YouTube password. This is a sufficient deterrent for kids if they don't know much about Web browsers. If they're Internet-savvy, though, they can learn quickly that there are three easy ways around Safety Mode:

                        Install a different Web browser, and use that to access YouTube instead
                        Delete the cookies in your Web browser: One of the YouTube cookies is what's keeping the browser locked in Safety Mode
                        Use the anonymous browsing feature in the most recent versions of most Web browsers</p>
