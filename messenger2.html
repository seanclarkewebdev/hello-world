             <h3>Using for Teaching</h3>

             <ol type="1">
             The app can be used for teaching and learning in it lot’s of ways.

            <li>It can make students and teachers lives easier by eliminating paper and expensive softwares</li>
            <li>Everyone already knows how to use it</li>
            <li>You can share multimedia</li>

                <p>
                For example if there was a group doing a project on a topic:

                The teacher could communicate the project with the students and all the details and post anything necessary to do it, instantly to a large group of students. 

                The students and teachers can share any multimedia to eachother. For example learning resources like videos or links to websites… or any sort of project the students create, they can share it.
                A teacher wants some students to do a project on games. They will send a group of students individually what they have to do for the project and how it will be graded. They will send them links to start off or to learn about the topic, websites, videos, etc. 

                The students doing the project create their own group chat and assign project roles and talk about how they are going to execute the project. They can use the resources and their research to accomplish the project within the grading guide set by the teacher by sharing information.

                Then the students decide to create a youtube video and a website displaying their project and make some sketches for a game of their own.

                They can then share the links with the teacher for the video, website and whatever content each student made.

                 For example they list what each student did and then get one student to send everything to the teacher. For example a website link, a youtube video link, pictures of sketches, etc.. 
                </p>

            <li>Posting class notes and assigning homework</li>
                 <p>
                 If a student is out or if the teacher is out, or if they just need to share homework they can instantly to all their students. 
                </p>

           <li>Students can share ideas</li>
                <p>
                They can all talk on messenger about anything including whatever they are learning.
                They can create a group chat for a topic or chapter or just for just for their class and discuss it.
                Some people learn better from working with others so this would help also.
                Even if you don’t you can still get ideas from others or share yours.
                </p>
                The teacher can make announcements about the school, class or work.

                <h3>Cautions and Warnings</h3>
                    <ol type="1">
                         <li>Account Hacking</li>
                        Just because you are receiving a Facebook chat message from your friend's account does not necessarily mean that it is your friend you are speaking with. The personal information and access to Facebook friends that comes from compromising a Facebook account makes them attractive targets for hackers. Consequently, the privacy and security of your chat messages depend on how well the other users you chat with secure their accounts.

                        <li>Direct Attacks</li>
                        Simply receiving messages through Facebook's chat system in your browser, or on the mobile app, does not pose a risk of infection to your computer. The message is simply text on a screen, and a chat message cannot coax Facebook into attacking your device. If you are using a third party instant messaging client to log into Facebook chat, however, you need to investigate if the client has any security vulnerabilities which hackers could exploit.

                        <li>Phishing</li>
                        While Facebook chat messages cannot directly attack your computer, the chat service can be a platform for phishing. If messages from a stranger – or a Facebook account which a hacker has compromised – contain links or files, then those websites or documents could infect your computer with malware. Ignoring links from strangers is easy, but hackers often exploit the fact that people are less vigilant about potentially suspicious links or documents perceived to have come from their friends.

                        <li>Facebook Data</li>
                        Facebook keeps records of all your activity on their site. This means that all your conversations will be a permanent fixture within Facebook's databases. Once you send something, the long-term security of that chat message is up to Facebook. Hackers that penetrate Facebook's security could get their hands on your chat transcripts. Furthermore, glitches in new Facebook features have exposed private messages before developers fixed the bugs.

                        <li>Spam</li>
                        Occasionally, your Facebook account may be compromised due to malware, spyware or phishing. When this occurs, a malicious individual or company may use your account to spam all your friends' accounts with wall postings, private messages or both. Some of these messages may even contain viruses, which could severely affect your friends' computers. Additionally, if a friend believes it's you behind the spamming, she may report you to Facebook.
