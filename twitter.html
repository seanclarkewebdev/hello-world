                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p>
                                Twitter is an application that you can download on any android or apple phone through the
                                app/play store for free. Twitter is a social media platform that allows you to post messages
                                known as “tweets”, it allows you to like posts by other users and retweet their posts on your
                                own page. Twitter was founded in 2006 in San Francisco. On twitter you can use the hashtag
                                key before a relevant word, this allows your tweets to be found easier by other users. By
                                clicking on a hashtag in a tweet it brings you to any other tweets that also include that word
                                or phrase. Twitters logo since 2010 is of a white bird on a light blue background. The bird is
                                said to be the “twitter bird” and that’s why the posts are called “tweets”, as that is the
                                sound the bird would make so it makes sense.

                            <h3>How to Register</h3>
                        <ol type="1">
                                <li>
                                 Registering an account for twitter is very simple and
                                easy that basically anybody at any age that’s old
                                enough for the application can make an account
                                All you need is either an email address or a phone
                                number to get started.
                                </li>

                                  <li>        
                                Once you type up twitter on google it will load you up
                                to this page where you can either make an account or
                                sign into an existing account, if the person already had
                                an account they would head straight into twitter and
                                wouldn’t see this page.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                When you press sign up you will be introduced to this
                                page and you have created a username for your
                                account and you also have to either put your email address down or your phone number
                                The reason you have to do either one of them is
                                because it will help twitter contact you just in case
                                something happened to your account
                                </li>

                                  <li>        
                                Once you made your account you will be brought into
                                this screen and depending on which option you picked
                                they will send a code to your email or number and ask
                                you to type it in just to make sure you’re not a bot or
                                fake account
                                 </li>

                                  <li>        
                                After that they will ask you to make a password it can
                                be anything it just has to be at least 6 letters long.
                                </li>

                                <li>        
                                After all that is done twitter will ask you to select thing
                                that you are interested in, this will help them find and
                                help you choose on what and who to follow on twitter since it’s your first time on the app
                                </li>

                            <p>On twitter as I mentioned the posts are called tweets. To tweet you would need to follow these next steps.</p>


                                <li>Click on the tweet button</li>
                                <li>to write your post</li>
                                <li>add any relevant hashtags that you may want to include & click tweet</li>

                            <p>Then your tweet will appear on your home page.</p>



                            <p>If you click on your blue hashtags it brings you to the page that shows all of the other tweets that include the same relevant word or phrase that you used.</p>
