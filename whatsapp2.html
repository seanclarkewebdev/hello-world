                 <h3>Using for Teaching</h3>

                 <ol type="1">
                 The app can be used for teaching and learning in it lot’s of ways.

                <li>It can make students and teachers lives easier by eliminating paper and expensive softwares</li>
                <li>Everyone already knows how to use it</li>
                <li>You can share multimedia</li>

                        <p>
                        For example if there was a group doing a project on a topic:

                        The teacher could communicate the project with the students and all the details and post anything necessary to do it, instantly to a large group of students. 

                        The students and teachers can share any multimedia to eachother. For example learning resources like videos or links to websites… or any sort of project the students create, they can share it.
                        A teacher wants some students to do a project on games. They will send a group of students individually what they have to do for the project and how it will be graded. They will send them links to start off or to learn about the topic, websites, videos, etc. 

                        The students doing the project create their own group chat and assign project roles and talk about how they are going to execute the project. They can use the resources and their research to accomplish the project within the grading guide set by the teacher by sharing information.

                        Then the students decide to create a youtube video and a website displaying their project and make some sketches for a game of their own.

                        They can then share the links with the teacher for the video, website and whatever content each student made.

                         For example they list what each student did and then get one student to send everything to the teacher. For example a website link, a youtube video link, pictures of sketches, etc.. 
                        </p>

                <li>Posting class notes and assigning homework</li>
                         <p>
                         If a student is out or if the teacher is out, or if they just need to share homework they can instantly to all their students. 
                        </p>

               <li>Students can share ideas</li>
                        <p>
                        They can all talk on messenger about anything including whatever they are learning.
                        They can create a group chat for a topic or chapter or just for just for their class and discuss it.
                        Some people learn better from working with others so this would help also.
                        Even if you don’t you can still get ideas from others or share yours.
                        </p>
                The teacher can make announcements about the school, class or work.

                        <p>
                    In May 2018, WhatsApp established that:

                            <br>
                    - If you live in any country outside the European Union, the minimum age
                    required to register on WhatsApp is 13 years old.
                            <br>
                    - If a person isn’t old enough to have authority to agree to WhatsApp Terms in his/hers country, the parents or the guardian must agree to the Terms on the minor’s behalf.

                            <br>
                        </p>
                    
                        <li>Caution (age limits, warnings of how it can be misused, privacy and
                        security, abuse)</li>
                        <p>- Warnings of how it can be misused:
                            “Beginning on December 7, 2019, WhatsApp will take legal action against
                            those we determine are engaged in or assisting others in abuse that violates our Terms of Service, such as automated or bulk messaging, or non-personal use, even if that determination is based on information solely available to us off our platform. For example, off-platform information includes public claims from companies about their ability to use WhatsApp in ways that violate our Terms.”
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                        <p> WhatsApp’s privacy setting gives the user the option to show his/hers profile photo, status, if the person saw the message or not (by         showing the two blue
                            ticks) and the last time the user was online.To have access to change all of that, you simply need to enter : 
                            <br>
                            WhatsApp→ 
                            <br>
                            Settings →

                            Account →
                            <br>
                            Privacy.
                        </p>
