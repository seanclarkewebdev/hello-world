                            To use the app Slack you must be older than 16 years old.
                            How it can be misused:
                            Slack provides a service for all users called ‘Channels’, channels allows you to communicate to a person or
                            a group through a hashtag set up by an admin when you join the hashtag you&#39;re a part of the group
                            channel. E.G. #businessclub
                            In regards to these ‘channels’ they can sometimes become more of a immature group chat than a
                            professional outlet where groups of people can share their files, emails or notes.

                            <li>Trolling/bullying</li>
                            Linking in with the use of ‘channels’ bullying can happen as when joining groups with people who have the
                            same interests but different outlooks can cause conflicts. There is not a lot of bullying documented on the
                            app which is a positive.
                            As slack was created for people to work together to communicate it unfortunately does not allow you to
                            block, mute or report people. This reason being the app wants you to work together to solve the issue as if
                            you were on a team.

                            Tips that can help when dealing with privacy from this app:
                            ● When ever using any social media app never share any personal details like passwords, financial
                            information
                            ● When ever using the app to communicate, remember that people can see directly who is talking so
                            don’t say something you will later regret
                        </ol>

                     <h3>Using for Teaching</h3>

                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Slack can be used to help in teaching in the making of study groups when doing group assignments. This way groups do not have to meet on scheduled days but can also communicate and help each other in the comfort of their own home sending files and emails to one another and exchanging ideas and asking for their opinion and since it is almost instant you dont have to worry about about a lag in communication.</li>


                            <li>It can also be for things other than study groups as it allow the class teacher or lecturer included to alway be able to interact with each other even outside of school allowing the student to get the most up to date information about work and events like when are grades our out straight from the staff. </li>

                            <li>Unlike Moodle, the moment a student posts a question or comment, you can receive a notification. And while this does not mean you’re obligated to respond immediately, at least you know to check in. Instructors are able to communicate observations and concerns in a way that more closely mimics a live classroom setting.</li>

                            <li>In the online classroom, Slack provides a space for dialogue without assessment, objectives or expectations. Setting up channels dedicated to specific purposes facilitates the ease of use, including channels such as #student_hours, #reading_questions, #general_questions and #discussion. Students can also tag you directly with a question using your ID or @channel to address the entire group.</li>
