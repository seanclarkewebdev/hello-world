                    <p>
                Slack is a type of instant messaging platform, similar to WhatsApp, snapchat and messenger, developed by
                Slack Technologies. It is meant to help people and their teams work together more seamlessly. It was
                designed this way in order to help support the way people naturally work together, so that they can
                collaborate with other people online as efficiently as you do face-to-face. The main part of slack is called
                the workspace, which is made of different channels, each belonging to a different team member where
                communicate and talk to each as well as send messages and share files. Your even able to make private
                channels for conversation between just you and an individual member, you can even start a voice or
                video call with any other members.
                The messages are almost instant so not only can you talk to one another but have full blown conversations.
