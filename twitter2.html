                    <h3>Cautions and Warnings</h3>
                Twitter has several things in place to give us control over our accounts. Their full privacy policy is
                found online, most easily through your own privacy settings on your account. The main things we
                have access over are:
                · Who sees your tweets – are your tweets completely public or locked for only each
                approved follower?
                · If you can be tagged in pictures – if this is ticked as no, then you cannot be attached to
                an image, however your name can be mentioned in a comment so this is kind of
                ineffective
                · Who can send you messages – much like your tweet privacy, can anyone send you a
                direct message or is it only your pre-approved followers?
                · If you can see sensitive media – if Twitter finds any material a sensitive topic, it gets
                blurred and you are warned before proceeding or have the option to back out.
                · Block and muting accounts – To block someone means they cannot view specifics
                which will be explained further below. You can also mute someone so that they don’t
                appear in your timeline but you can still follow them, contact them etc.

                A blocked twitter user can pretty much still see everything that you tweet, favourite, retweet, etc.
                You, as a blocker, are more effected. The blocked user:
                · Is removed from your follower list
                · Will not show up in your timeline, whether it’s their own account tweeting or someone
                else you follow retweeting them
                · Will not be able to reply or @ you
                · Will not show on your timeline via retweets, favourites etc.

                What is public on Twitter from your account regardless is:
                · Your timezone and language
                · How old your account is
                · When and where you tweet
                · Your likes, replies and comment
                · Your address book if you upload it
                · Your twitter handle (username)
                · Your picture and header
                · Your name of which you can choose yourself
                You can control some of this through your own device by turning your locations off. You can also
                delete your previous locations, address book and any other optional data you upload. You are
                required to give an email to log in, but a phone number is not required unless you wish to use it or
                you use two-step authentication for logging in. Twitter also use cookies for their ads but you can
                fine tune your ads or change it completely.
                You can report a user or a tweet. This report falls under specific categories and then Twitter have
                a team set up so that they will determine if it’s true and to which punishment the user will get,
                varying from the user having to delete the tweet, not being able to tweet just read their timeline, or
                having to delete their account.
                There are also ‘verified users’ for certain users. Initially, this was done based on how many
                followers someone had but has changed over the years. There’s now a process. Firstly, you must
                fill out a form. Then you need:
                · Verified phone number and email – for the email, it is said for example if it’s a business
                to use an email related to the business
                · A bio, header and icon
                · Your birthday
                · A website linked in the correct place (not your bio)
                · Your tweets public
                There are tips and tricks online but really it just comes down to the verification team. This process
                is still new and not available everywhere.

                <li>Announcing field trips</li>
                Students love surprises. Therefore, write a creative 140 characters long description of the great field trip you will all take together… if the classroom results are good for everyone. Within minutes, you will see dozens of messages congratulating you for the idea. Plus, by advertising the field trip through Twitter, everyone will get a real time notification.

                <li>Subscribe to relevant hashtags</li>
                Discuss with students in the classroom what issues they would like to follow on Twitter. Have a talk on the relevant issues for your class, and then decide together what hashtags you should all follow. By getting regular news updates through following, there will always be an interesting topic to debate in class. Using Twitter in education provides a great way of socialization and encourages students to speak up for the issues they believe in, and become opinionated.

                <li>Tweet about changes in the program</li>
                If there is any change your students should know about, you can use Twitter to inform them. For example, if the class will be held in another classroom or if the class will be skipped the next day. Students receive instant notifications, and they can share with fellow students. If there is any last minute change regarding the school program, just send out a short tweet.
