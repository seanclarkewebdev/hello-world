                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                YouTube is an American online video-sharing platform headquartered in San Bruno, California. Three former PayPal employees—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—created the service in February 2005. Google bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries. YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to other users. It offers a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos.

                        <h3>How to Register</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Go to YouTube.com and click the Sign Up link</li>
                    The Sign Up link is at the top-right of the page. This link takes you to the Create Your YouTube Account page.


                    <li>Enter your e-mail address and a password</li>
                    You must enter a valid e-mail address to register.

                    <li>Fill in the Re-type Password and Username fields</li>
                    It’s a good idea to jot down your username and password in case you forget it.

                    <li>Check the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy box after you read all the legalese</li>
                    You don’t need a law degree to understand this “fine print.”

                    <li>Click the Create My Account button</li>
                    If you leave any fields empty or if you choose a username that’s taken already, YouTube refreshes the page with red warning notes identifying the fields that need to be corrected before you can register.

                            <h3>How to Use</h3>
                        <li>Create a channel</li>
                    <p>
                    To create a YouTube channel, you will need a Google account. You can either use an existing Google account or create a new one for your business.

                    Once you have created your account and navigated to YouTube, you will be asked to name your channel. We suggest using the name of your business, as it will be the most recognizable. You want to make it easy for your target audience to find you! Remember, YouTube is basically a search engine (and is powered/owned by the world’s largest search engine – Google). Consider specifically how people would search to find what your business offers.

                     <li>Begin making and uploading videos</li>
                    Now, it’s time for the fun part!

                    Gather all the equipment you have and go shoot some video footage. Don’t have a ton of recording equipment lying around? No worries. Even if you’re only working with your smartphone, you can still make a really great video as long as it’s useful to your audience.

                    Remember to be confident and have fun. Great videos always have good energy; if you’re not having fun making the video, your audience probably won’t have fun watching it!

                    <li>Share your videos</li>
                    While your videos will likely get some traffic through organic search alone, don’t hesitate to promote your videos through your other online channels, such as your website.

                    The people who have already connected with you on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Pinterest are likely to appreciate your new videos as well.

                    And don’t forget about email! Including a video in your next email is a great way to engage your subscribers and drive traffic to your YouTube page.
