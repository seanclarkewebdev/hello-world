                        <li>Open what’s app on your mobile device and you will see
                        the main chat page.
                        This is where you keep track of all messages, calls and
                        status changes. Along the top row you have the search tab
                        so you can look for recent or not so recent messages.
                        Beside the search tab is the settings with three dots. This
                        is used to open a new group chat, all your favourite or
                        (starred) messages and out to change your account
                        settings along with themes, wallpaper and how you receive
                        notifications.
                        On the bottom right corner is the message tab where you

                        want to write and hit enter. If this is too slow for you
                        or you prefer to talk you can use the record setting on
